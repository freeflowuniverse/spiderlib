## Application Architecture

A VWeb application follows the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture is separated into 3 domains: 
- View: Responsible for serving view components & html
- Controller: Responsible for modifying/accessing model, and returning model data. Called by view.
- Model: Holds data, can use db, memory etc, is not concurrent.

### Example Architecture

For instance, a Chess Application will have the following files:

`chess_view.v`

```
pub fn (app App) board() vweb.Result {
    app.
}

struct ChessMove{
    player string
    piece string
    origin string
    destination string
}

[POST]
pub fn (app App) move() vweb.Result {
    controller_
    return app.html('You moved piece ${move.piece}' to position ${move.position} )
}
```
